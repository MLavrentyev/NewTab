# NewTab
This is a new tab page meant to be displayed when a new tab is opened in a browser.

#Installation
For Firefox (including 41 and later), download the New Tab Override Add-on (here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/). Set the option to "Custom URL" and set the directory to where the index.html file is located.

#Description
The new tab page displays hotlinks at the top of the page for commonly-used pages. These can be modified in the headerConfig.json file. Additional settings can be set in the settings.json file. If nearest or farthest city is choosen, you will need an internet connection to use it. If none is available, a random city background is loaded.
